decided to change from actualy buttons to divs as the buttons would keep staying displayed - this idea was taken from carino, thought i could make it would by using buttons but this didnt seem to be the case.

Credits 

https://codepen.io/gcarino/details/AaJBOo - although used this idea and followed along with the code, i did change it up and added my own things to it, I liked the idea however i didnt feel confident to create it on my own and needed the extra support. I did find a lot of struggles with this langauge because of all the math-like code and I have always struggled with maths, but I am confident the more I do and practise the easier it will become and I will understand it. - styled the css on my own - mainly used the JS part and the inital layout for the html for an idea on how to set it out. the rest i redesigned to my liking.
